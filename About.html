        We designed the CafeTO Access Tracker to understand how well the CafeTO program is serving Torontonians from 
        both a transportation perspective and from a disability perspective.
        <br><br>
        How easy is it to access patio cafes by public transit? Bike lanes? 
        Are the patios is the densest areas? How does income predit access to CafeTO patios?
        We hope our map can be useful for evaluating CafeTO's role in shaping Toronto's urban environment, 
        generating discussion about accessibility, and helping guide future decisions regarding the CafeTO program.
        <br>
        <br>
        We aim to fill a gap left by existing CafeTO web infrastructure: the program website does not share data year-round, 
        nor does it show previous locations. We hope we can continue to improve our website to provide information that is helpful to 
        people interested in CafeTO locations, restaurant owners who might be interested in participating, and regulatory bodies 
        evaluating both the program at large and any changes they make to it.

      </div>
      <div class="card-text">
        CafeTO emerged as a response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The City of Toronto first piloted the program in 2020 to 
        allow restuarants open while indoor dining was prohivited. CafeTO is particularly interesting because of how it has 
        repurposed existing infrastructure; the city appropriated curb lanes for the restaurant patios at a time when traffic 
        levels had fallen below normal due to the pandemic. As the city returns to gridlock, the continued presence of CafeTO on vehicular 
        transportation may be worth investigating.
        <br><br>
        CafeTO programming is still being reshaped. In February 2023, the City of Toronto introduced new fees for restaurateurs 
        looking to participate in the program. Many restaurant operators have expressed the fees are prohibitively expensive.
        <br><br>
        Accessibility is also a concern. In the past, the city provided asphalt ramps that restaurant owners and accessibility 
        advocates critiqued for being ill-placed, crumbly, and inconvenient for wheelchair users. Last summer, the City of Toronto 
        stopped providing ramps. The new regulations propose improving accessibility by mandating all patios be built on a platform 
        level with the sidewalk, but some restaurant owners see these regulations as further obstacles to 
        participation in the program.

      <div class="card-text">
        We are three University of Toronto students interested in transportation and accessibility. 
        We are all part of the urban studies, human geography, and GIS programs at the univeristy.
        Having watched the sidewalks and streets of our city change over the course of the pandemic,
        we became interested in mapping that change.
