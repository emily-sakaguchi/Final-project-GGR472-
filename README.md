# Final-project-GGR472-

This code, with the help of Mapbox API, Turf.js, and Bootstrap, incorporates JS, HTML, and CSS to create a website focusing on the CafeTO locations in the City of Toronto. The main focus of this site is the map, which displays the accessibility of the CafeTO locations by different modes of transportation (bus, subway, bike), along with socio-demographic layers (average income, population density, and means disability benefits received). There is also a buffer layer of the subway stations to emphasize the accessibiltiy of these CafeTO locations. These individual layers can be turned on and off through checkboxes and drop-down menus. The map also includes map controls and a geocoder. Other pages of the website includes an "About" page, "Share your ideas" page, and a "News" page. 

The data sources are listed below:
- City of Toronto Open Data Portal
    - Neighoubrhood boundaries shapefile
    - Demographic data
    - CafeTO locations shapefile
    - Cycling network shapefile
- Metrolinx
    - TTC subway station shapefile
- UofT Map and Data Library
    - TTC bus routes shapefile

All of the shapefiles were converted to GeoJSONs.
